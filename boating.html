                <p align="center">BOATS & THE INJURY CLAIMANT</p>
                <p>There is a common expression that the two happiest days in the life of a boater are when a person
                    buys a boat and the day it is sold. So far I’ve had 9 such days. I have to use an asterisk after 9.
                    One wasn’t sold as it was demolished in a rear end accident on a rural highway.</p>
                <p>Before taking a personal injury statement or deposition you need to research marine and motor vehicle
                    records. You are checking for boat, motors and trailers through the Missouri Department of Revenue
                    and personal property records from the Assessor of the county in which the subject resides. You need
                    to conduct both inquiries. Allow enough time to have any records certified. Let’s look at the more
                    common Missouri boating scenarios as it may apply to your claimant.</p>
                <p>A jon boat is a flat bottom aluminum craft which can range in length from ten to twenty feet. That
                    type of boat is typically used for fishing and for the hard-core outdoorsman who waterfowl hunts. If
                    you have a plaintiff admitting to owning a boat, you need to determine the length, the approximate
                    weight, the horsepower rating and how it is used. How the boat is transported is equally
                    important.</p>
                <p>Few claimants would admit to using an oar to row a small boat. That is fine. The alternative is to
                    use an electric trolling motor and/or an outboard motor. A trolling motor is powered by a car size
                    battery. Who is carrying forty pounds of battery back and forth to the boat?</p>
                <p>If using a stern mounted trolling motor, maneuvering a boat is often done in an outstretched
                    position. Your body is facing forward to see where you are going. At the same time one hand is on
                    the tiller with that side of the body partially twisted. That will significant if someone is
                    claiming an injury from the waist up</p>
                <p>You need to know the size, year and make of an outboard motor if it is not attached by steering
                    cables to the boat. Ask if this an electric or a manual start motor. If it is a manual start, think
                    about what body strain is involved while twisting the upper torso in rope starting a motor from a
                    seated position. On smaller motors, how is it being transported to and from the boat if it is not
                    cabled to the transom? A 9.9 horsepower outboard motor is the most commonly used on jon boats. The
                    motor will weigh between 74 and 111 pounds. The weight will vary by make and vintage so ask about
                    both. You have a lot of weight to hand carry, which is of interest especially for someone with a
                    lifting restriction.</p>
                <p>On smaller boats with outboard motors a portable gas tank is used. That could be either a three or
                    six gallon tank. 6 gallons of gas times 6.15 pounds per gallon, add the weight of the tank and
                    someone is lifting forty pounds of metal and petro.</p>
                <p>If the claimant admits to using a boat, how it is transported? Smaller boats might be hauled in the
                    back of a pickup truck or hoisted onto a vehicle roof. Either way, there is a lot of aluminum and
                    gear being lifted repeatedly. See if you can tie down the plaintiff in a deposition or statement if
                    he/she ever fishes or boats alone. The more you can box the subject into doing either alone the
                    better. Ask this before you get into the boat usage.</p>
                <p>If a water craft is being hauled on a trailer this too requires work. The boat has to be winched
                    forward onto the trailer for the return trip home. The heavier the boat the more strength and motion
                    range is required. You have tie downs on the back of most boat trailers. Once more you are bending,
                    stretching and applying force to secure the load. All this is done after a day of fishing, skiing,
                    swimming or other physically demanding activity.</p>
                <p>Boat rides on larger lakes can be a bone jarring experience. Depending on the boat and the size of
                    the waves, you might have a pounding ride. That is not good for someone with a bad back or neck.
                    Cover which bodies of water the subject frequents. A boat ride on the Lake of the Ozarks can be a
                    walk on the wild side. Ask if they or a family member owns property, a timeshare or a membership on
                    a lake or resort area. If they do, when was it purchased? Ideally this would be after the claim
                    date.</p>
                <p>Care and maintenance of a boat and trailer is mandatory. Periodically you have to check the trailer
                    tires, grease the wheel bearings, move gear and climb about the craft. Boats don’t clean themselves.
                    Once more someone has to bend, stoop and climb about a watercraft to properly care for it.</p>
                <p>Find out the various usage of the boat. This can open the door to all types of activities. When was
                    it bought? Was it after the claim date? Did the claimant upgrade to a larger, faster, newer or
                    multi-purpose boat (i.e. a fish & ski)? Are there water skis in the family? Don’t forget to conduct
                    a comprehensive social website search checking for public photos or posts about activity
                    inconsistent with their reported injuries. That search should include the subject of the
                    investigation and members of the household.</p>
                <p>Be sure to ask if they or anyone in the family owns a personal watercraft like a wave runner.
                    Sometimes a plaintiff doesn’t equate a personal watercraft as being a boat so ask enough questions.
                    Even if you received a negative response ask if the subject has been on a personal watercraft since
                    the claim date. Be sure to run the record searches on members of the household besides your
                    claimant. We’ve had a number of cases where a marine record search found nothing on the claimant
                    only to locate a boat or other big boy toys in the name of a spouse or significant other.</p>
                <p>Prior to any deposition certified hunting and fishing permits should have been obtained. A databank
                    search does not qualify as a proper search. These records are dated, missing crucial information and
                    cannot be certified.</p>
                <p>You want to know in advance if the plaintiff has a fishing license, a duck stamp, and hunting license
                    all which could provide useful information on boating and strenuous activity. You can’t pull records
                    if you don’t know they exist. This article lightly touches on the subject. If you need to fine-tune
                    your questions regarding boats, motors and trailers, give me a call. Unfortunately, I speak from
                    experience. ☺</p>
