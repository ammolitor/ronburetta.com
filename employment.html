                <p>Our principal opened his agency in 1981. We’ve shared many of
                    the same experiences that you have had in running a
                    business. Some of the headaches are beyond your control.
                    Bringing problem employees on board is something you can.
                    This type of investigation provides the highest cost to
                    benefit ratio. It is a lot easier to avoid a problem than to
                    solve one. It is also a lot cheaper.</p>
                <p>Lawsuits regarding employment screening continued to increase
                    for a number of reasons. Let’s start at the beginning.
                    Before conducting a pre-employment background check, you
                    must have a signed release. It has to be a standalone
                    document not buried in the application. What is permissible
                    to ask in one state may not be in another. It can even vary
                    city by city within the same state.</p>
                <p>With more state legalizing recreational marijuana review your
                    company guidelines regarding drug screening during both the
                    hiring and retention process. Have a well versed attorney
                    review your employment application. Ban the box statutes,
                    overly broad questions or terms such as maiden name can lead
                    to legal problems. More states are enacted expungement laws
                    which erase criminal histories from the public record.
                    Missouri implement that change on January 1, 2018. Be aware
                    of what you can and cannot ask.</p>
                <p>A pre-employment background check is considered a consumer
                    report. It falls under the guidelines of the Fair Credit
                    Report Act. If an applicant is denied employment, retention
                    or a promotion based on that report there are specific steps
                    to follow. Acquaint yourselves with the FCRA, follow those
                    guidelines and it will further insulate you from employment
                    litigation. Smaller companies without the advice of counsel
                    or lacking a human resource professional are the most at
                    risk. If in doubt on what is legal, ask. Tragically,
                    workplace violence is making the news more than ever.
                    Screening of applicants will reduce that risk. If the
                    unthinkable still happens, the employer can at least
                    document proper screening procedures were in place.</p>
