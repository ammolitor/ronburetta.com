            <div class="text">
                <p>If a case is serious enough to need an investigator, it
                    warrants using one with a proven track record. We've been in
                    business since 1981. Many of our clients have worked with
                    the same investigators for decades. The 2019 merger with CDA
                    of Eastern Missouri adds another thirty years of
                    investigative experience.</p>
                <p>For those in the insurance industry, you've seen our
                    performance for many years. I would encourage you to review
                    the publication section of our website. Many of the articles
                    focus on suspected fraud and pre-trial preparation. These
                    have been published in PI Magazine, The Investigative News,
                    Claims Education and in our newsletters. They are based on
                    our principal's investigative career which began in 1974.
                    The articles cover decades of upping the odds of success
                    while staying legally inbounds.</p>
                <p>Between 2015 and 2017 at least three lawsuits were filed in
                    the St. Louis bi-state area. All involved flat rate
                    surveillance and were flawed from the start. You can't
                    properly prepare for work in the field if there is no budget
                    to do so.</p>
                <p>The Missouri driver's license is record legally available for
                    licensed private investigators. When you videotape the wrong
                    person and the claimant is then turned into the Insurance
                    Crime Bureau, litigation happens. Repeatedly trespassing
                    over four days claiming you thought you were on national
                    forest land didn't fly with another jury. Online research
                    would have quickly confirmed there wasn't an inch of
                    national forest in the entire county. It would have also
                    shown photographs of the subject's home and outbuilding.
                    That would have helped when the investigators spent a half
                    day watching the wrong house. The third case involved
                    contacting under pretext a represented plaintiff. Add
                    videotaping a person inside their residence in Illinois
                    which is prohibited. You need enough financial leeway to
                    hire, train and retain experienced professionals</p>
                <p>In all three cases the insurance company clients of the
                    investigative agencies were also named as defendants. The
                    investigators conduct rose to the level where three
                    different courts were going to allow punitive damages. Two
                    settled after years of litigation while the third had a jury
                    verdict with a high low settlement already in place. Our
                    principal was the expert witness on that case.</p>
                <p>In 2016 Buretta served twice more as an expert witness. One
                    involved a FELA case in a plaintiff friendly jurisdiction.
                    The second involved a terribly flawed pre-employment
                    screening which had devastating consequences. You hire an
                    investigator to solve a problem not to create one.</p>
                <p>For those in the legal profession you too have had decades of
                    seeing our work product. Our lectures have been accepted by
                    multiple law firms as part of their continuing education
                    requirements. Our agency is licensed in Missouri and
                    Illinois should you case need work on either side of the
                    river.</p>
                <p>For the general public our agency is closing in on forty
                    years of problem solving. After you have reviewed this
                    website, Google search our name. You need to make certain
                    that hiring an investigator will help solve, avoid or
                    mitigate a problem. Sometimes it won't. Have the statute of
                    limitations run, is what you want legal, is it admissible or
                    will it make a difference in the courtroom or in
                    negotiations? All these factors and more must be considered.
                    An hour consultation would be the money well spent on
                    deciding if your case would benefit in using a professional
                    investigator.</p>
                <p>If you are in the legal, insurance or a business community,
                    we are available in the St. Louis area as a guest speaker at
                    no charge. Subject matter and time can be structured to your
                    specific needs. These are not infomercials. The
                    presentations are designed to increase investigative
                    effectiveness and call out those practices traveling in the
                    wrong direction.</p>
                <p>Our writings, speaking engagements, website, radio
                    presentations and work product make an open statement of our
                    experience, business practices and results. Attorney Steve
                    Sexauer, now retired, said something to me during my first
                    year in business which I never forgot. It was "Ron, if it
                    were easy, I wouldn't need to call you". Clients have been
                    calling since 1981</p>
