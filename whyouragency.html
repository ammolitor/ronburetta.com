            <div class="text">
                <p>Our principal began his investigative career in 1974. We've been in business since 1981. The October
                    2012 newsletter from the Missouri Board of Private Investigators outlined how 349 employee license
                    renewals applications were mailed. A staggering 190 employee licenses were not renewed. The client,
                    one way or another, is shortchanged when an agency has a 54% turnover rate over a two year time
                    period. Many of our clients have worked with the same staff investigators for over thirty years.
                    Your case deserves an experienced investigator.</p>
                <p>If you are a business owner, you know the headaches that you can't control. Proper screening of job
                    applicants is something you can. It is a lot easier to avoid a problem then to solve one. It is also
                    a lot cheaper. Look over the services section of our website and see where we can help.</p>
                <p>For those in the insurance industry, you've seen our performance for many years. I would encourage
                    you to review the publication section of our website. These articles are heavily focused on
                    surveillance, fraud investigation and pre-trial preparation. They are based on forty two years of
                    upping the odds of success and staying legally inbounds during the investigation. We've presented
                    dozens of lectures on the topics of surveillance, fraud, investigations and investigative practices.
                    The two recently concluded Missouri lawsuits against investigators and their insurance company
                    clients plus a fresh one in Illinois should be a wakeup call.</p>
                <p>For those in the legal profession, you too have had decades of seeing our work product. Our lectures
                    have been accepted by multiple law firms as part of their continuing education requirements. Our
                    agency is licensed in Missouri and Illinois should your case involve work on either side of the
                    river.</p>
                <p>If you are in the legal, insurance or business professions, we are available in the bi-state area as
                    a guest speaker at no charge. Subject matter and time can be tailored to your specific needs. These
                    are not infomercials. They are designed to increase investigative effectiveness and call out those
                    practices that travel in the opposite direction.</p>
                <p>For the general public, we haven't forgotten about you. Our agency has served Missouri and Illinois
                    for decades. We encourage prospective clients to Google search our name.</p>
                <p>Our writings, speaking engagements, website, radio presentations and work product make an open
                    statement of our experience, business practices and results. Long-time client and friend Steve
                    Sexauer said something to me during my first year in business. It was "Ron, if it were easy, I
                    wouldn't need to call you". People have been calling us since 1981.</p>
