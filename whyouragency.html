		<div class="title">Why Our Agency</div>
		<div class="text">
<p>Our principal started his investigative career in 1974 while working for a competitor of Equifax. If you locate a 1981 telephone book, you'll find our first business listing. If you check online with the Missouri Secretary of State you'll see our 1982 incorporation in Bridgeton, Missouri. We were at that location almost 32 years until the property was recently sold. We'll be here when your case goes to trial years after the investigation. </p>
<p>The October 2012 newsletter from the Missouri Board of Private Investigators had some eye opening statistics. The most glaring was the turnover rate for agency employees. 349 employee license renewal applicants were mailed out by the Board. A staggering 190 employee licenses were not renewed. What does that say about the quality of personnel and an agency with a 54 % turnover rate? Your case deserves an experienced investigator. Many of our clients have worked with the same staff investigators for twenty five, thirty years and longer. </p>
<p>For the business owner, we know what the bottom line is. We've been making payroll and running a company since 1981. We've seen the ripple effect of bad employees in the work place or clients entering into a business venture based on bad intelligence. It is a lot easier to avoid a problem than to solve one. Look over our list of services and see where we can help.</p>
<p>For the general public, we don't do free consultations. Why is that? It is because you get what you pay for. We have people in emotional, life changing situations contacting us on a regular basis. Does an investigator provide them with objective advice and charge according or does the "free" consultation sell them on services which will not solve their problem? You don't need to spend money on an investigation if your objectives will not be met due to the inadmissibility of evidence, the statutes of limitations having run or what you are seeking having no bearing on the outcome of the case. </p>
<p>For those in the insurance industry, you've seen our work product for decades. If you are thinking about surveillance, ask for a reprint of Surveillance Factors-Educate Claims Personnel. This will give you an unbiased analysis if surveillance is even feasible on your case. In many instances it is not. If so, you might want to either change investigative directions or put that money towards a different file. If you really want to dissect surveillance, look at the publication section of this website. Ask for copies of those articles related to suspected fraud and increasing investigative effectiveness. </p>
<p>For the legal community, you too have had decades of seeing our work product. Each employee has been with our agency a minimum of twenty six years. Our agency is licensed in Missouri and Illinois which is a consideration when your case involves work on either side of the river. </p>
<p>We have authored numerous newsletters and magazine articles with emphasis on surveillance, fraud investigations and record resources. We have presented over seventy lectures to the insurance, legal, business and educational communities. We have provided expert testimony before the Administrative Law Committee of the Missouri House of Representatives, the Missouri Division of Employment Security, the Missouri Division of Family Services, the Illinois Industrial Commission, US District Courts and circuit courts in the bi-state area. </p>
<p>Our writings, speaking engagements, website, radio presentations, over thirty three years in business, long term employees and work product make an open statement of our experience, business practices and results. Investigations are a serious business. Sometimes you don't get a second chance.</p>
