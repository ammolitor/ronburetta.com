            <div class="text">
                <p>If a case is serious enough to warrant the use of an
                    investigator, it also warrants using one with a proven track
                    record. We've been in business since 1981. Many of our
                    clients have worked with the same investigators for over
                    thirty five years. Missouri first required licensing of
                    private investigators in 2010. Two years later, 349 agency
                    employees were sent renewal applications by the Missouri
                    Board of Private Investigators. Of that number, 190
                    employees renewed for a turnover rate of 54%. Your case
                    deserves an experienced investigator not a revolving
                    door.</p>
                <p>For those in the insurance industry, you've seen our
                    performance for many years. I would encourage you to review
                    the publication section of our website. Many of the articles
                    focus on suspected fraud and pre-trial preparation. These
                    have been published in PI Magazine, The Investigative News,
                    Claims Education and in our newsletters. They are based on
                    our principal's investigative career which started in 1974.
                    The articles cover forty four years of upping the odds of
                    success while staying legally inbounds.</p>
                <p>Between 2015 and 2017 at least three lawsuits were filed in
                    the St. Louis bi-state area. All involved flat rate worker's
                    compensation surveillance some which were flawed from the
                    start. You can't research records if you don't know they
                    exist. You can't properly prepare for work in the field if
                    there is no budget to do so. You need enough financial
                    leeway to retain experienced people. In each lawsuit, the
                    clients of the investigative agencies were also named as
                    defendants. The investigators conduct rose to the level
                    where the courts were going to allow punitive damages. Two
                    cases settled while the third had a jury verdict with a high
                    low settlement already in place. Our principal was the
                    expert witness on the case that went to a jury.</p>
                <p>This was followed up by him being an expert witness twice in
                    2016. Those two cases involved flawed background
                    investigations. The lack of proper screening had devastating
                    consequences. You hire an investigator to solve a problem
                    not to create another.</p>
                <p>If you are a business owner, we know the headaches you can't
                    control. Proper screening of job applicants is something you
                    can. It is a lot easier to avoid a problem than to solve
                    one. It is also a lot cheaper. Litigation over employee
                    misconduct is rising along with workplace violence.
                    Pre-employment screening offers the best benefit to cost
                    ratio of any investigation. We've shared many of same
                    experiences you've had in running a business. Look over the
                    services section of this website and see where we can help
                    increase your bottom line.</p>
                <p>For those in the legal profession you too have had decades of
                    seeing our work product. Our lectures have been accepted by
                    multiple law firms as part of their continuing education
                    requirements. Our agency is licensed in Missouri and
                    Illinois should you case need work on either side of the
                    river.</p>
                <p>For the general public we are now in our fourth decade of
                    problem solving. After you have reviewed this website,
                    Google search our name. You need to make certain that hiring
                    an investigator will help solve, avoid or mitigate a
                    problem. Sometimes it won't. Have the statute of limitations
                    run, is what you want legal, is it admissible or will it
                    make a real difference in the courtroom? All these factors
                    and more must be considered before spending money on an
                    investigator.</p>
                <p>If you are in the legal, insurance or a business community,
                    we are available in the St. Louis area as a guest speaker at
                    no charge. Subject matter and time can be structured to your
                    specific needs. These are not infomercials. The
                    presentations are designed to increase investigative
                    effectiveness and call out those practices traveling in the
                    wrong direction.</p>
                <p>Our writings, speaking engagements, website, radio
                    presentations and work product make an open statement of our
                    experience, business practices and results. Attorney Steve
                    Sexauer, now retired, said something to me during my first
                    year in business which I never forgot. It was “Ron, if it
                    were easy, I wouldn't need to call you”. Clients have been
                    calling since 1981.</p>
