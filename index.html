                <hr/>
                <p><strong>June 1st - </strong>We were honored to one of our publications reprinted in the newsletter of the El Dorado Insurance Agency, Inc. The article was entitled <cite>Surveillance and Trespassing</cite>.  Over the past forty years we’ve had fourteen articles published. If you would be interested in receiving copies, please let us know. We do not provide a link since the contents are for clients not the general public. Refer to the publication section of our website to request articles most suited for your profession. The articles focus on surveillance, investigations and pre-employment screening while staying legally inbounds.</p>
                <p><strong>July 15th - </strong>Marked the two year anniversary when CDA and our agency joined forces. Each complimented the other in expanding expertise and manpower. This was a win for clients, employees and both agencies.</p>
                <p><strong>July 20th - </strong>We conducted an investigation in which a nationwide screening agency gave a favorable report on a job applicant. The newly hired employee then committed a horrendous crime. This was a repeat of a prior conviction for the same offense for which he deservedly served time in prison. Employers roll the legal dice in their choice of investigators. This is not the first time we’ve investigated or testified as an expert witness regarding terribly flawed work product. We’ll eventually add more details once this case works its’ way through the criminal court.</p>
                <p><strong>August 5th - </strong>Marked our forty year business anniversary. During those years we shared with clients their joy and sorrow, fishing trips and funerals, cases won and lost. You’ve invited us into your business life and in many cases your personal life. Your friendship and trust is very meaningful to us.</p>
                <p><strong>November 10th - </strong>A prominent law firm client was victimized by hackers. A ransom ware demand was made and paid. This is the second time in the past two years high end clients have been victimized. Use top shelve IT professionals to lessen the odds of you becoming a victim.</p>
                <p><strong>November 22nd - </strong>Marked the one year anniversary of the passing of Lance Corporal Joseph Martin Hueckel. There are no words to adequately describe the display of love on this heartbreaking loss. One day there will be a joyful reunion beyond description for those who live the Word during our temporal time on earth.</p>
                <p><strong>December 1st - </strong>One of our major databank services quit offering utility records searches. Every year there seems to be is a bite out of our investigative tools. We’ll get by as we have for decades. The end result is more hoops to jump through in our effort to combat fraud and protect the interests of our clients.</p>
                <p>This past year, like multiple times every year, we were approached to work as a sub-contractor by agencies advertising nationwide service. In some instances, the proposed compensation was less than what we pay our employees. In all but one case, we declined the offers. You have the right to know who is working your case. Don’t be bashful about having direct contact with the field investigator especially during the course of surveillance. There should not be a buffer between the client and those handling the assignment. Be certain the investigator(s) are licensed as legally required in most states. You don’t need a sideshow in court when improper licensing becomes an issue.</p>
                <p>Best wishes.</p>
