                <hr/>
                <p>We wish to say thanks for allowing us to handle your cases
                    for the past forty years. Multiple clients came on board in
                    1981 and remain to this day. Your business and friendship is
                    sincerely appreciated.</p>
                <p>2021 marks the second year in which CDA and our agency
                    merged. Year one went very smooth. That was expected as it
                    was a two year search to find someone who was on the same
                    business and life page. The additional manpower and
                    expertise benefited both companies and clients.</p>
                <p>In 2020 a client was forced to pay ransom when hackers took
                    control of their corporate computers. This was a high end
                    business staffed by educated professionals yet their
                    safeguards did not match the skill levels of the criminals.
                    Have and follow a strict set of guidelines for use of
                    corporate computers. Make sure your virus protection is
                    updated on a regular basis. It is a lot cheaper in the long
                    term.</p>
                <p>In 2020 a former neighbor had concerns about spyware and
                    possible hacking on his home computer. He was relieved when
                    he spoke with a "representative" from Microsoft. On the same
                    call he was patched into a "representative" from US Bank
                    Who, while still on the same connection, put him in touch
                    with the "FBI".</p>
                <p>If your computer freezes up with an alert flashing to call a
                    toll free telephone number and not to turn off your
                    computer, it is a scam. Microsoft doesn't then engage you in
                    a three way call to your bank then the FBI. There were
                    multiple red flags in which the old neighbor did not pick up
                    on. He and his wife grew up with middle class family values
                    where you went by the rules and did the right things in
                    life. It is sometimes hard to step back from that upbringing
                    and realize there are many people in the world who are the
                    polar opposites. They are experts in the con and make a good
                    living by preying on the unsuspecting.</p>
                <p>If you are computer savvy, help out those who are not. Let
                    those people know about the more commons scams and phishing
                    expeditions. They don't need to make a $75,000 mistake like
                    the former neighbor.</p>
                <p>On legislative matters in the bi-state area there were no
                    substantial changes having a negative impact on our
                    profession. Over the past decade there were some gradual but
                    negative changes in the availability of Missouri records.
                    Lobbyist for the investigative, insurance and legal
                    communities need to be on the watch for misguided privacy
                    laws which hamper access to the tools needed by these
                    professions. They also need to be on the alert for free
                    spending states eyeing a tax on professional services.</p>
                <p>Speaking of professions, make certain those conducting your
                    investigations are properly licensed. There is no
                    reciprocity between Missouri and Illinois. All states want
                    the licensing revenue. Ask for documentation. If they are
                    performing investigative services they need a license no
                    matter how someone dresses up their job title. Don't let the
                    lack of a license become a sideshow on credibility and
                    possibility in the admission of evidence in the
                    courtroom.</p>
                <p>In closing, we wish to say thanks to all who offered support
                    and prayers for the Hueckel family. Lance Corporal Joseph
                    Martin Hueckel died in the service of our great country on
                    November 22, 2020. He now is with our Heavenly Father. Your
                    kindness will never be forgotten.</p>
