                <p>In July 2019 CDA of East Central Missouri and our agency
                    merged. Martin Hueckel of CDA has years of investigative
                    accomplishments. This includes thirteen years of operating
                    his agency in the St. Louis area. Before that, he spent
                    fourteen years as a surveillance agent then as a case
                    manager for a national investigative agency. Prior to that
                    he served in the military where he attended the U.S. Army
                    Military Police Academy and the Primary Leadership Academy.
                    His integrity, work ethic and experience made him an ideal
                    fit. He assumes the role as managing partner. Our contact
                    information is as follows.

                <p>On the legislative front this past year was good. There were
                    no major roadblocks added in our fight against fraud and in
                    retaining access to many records. A hiccup was the Missouri
                    Driver’s License Bureau now requires more steps to obtain a
                    copy of a person’s license photograph. This has slowed the
                    turnaround time but keeping this resource was important.
                <p>In 2019 we had more offers than ever to work as a
                   subcontractor for other agencies. Most of the requests
                   involved surveillance assignments. Only a few offers were
                   accepted. What was part of most proposals was a fee schedule
                   sometimes less than what we pay our own employees. Someone
                   is taking these cases based on a willingness to work cheap.
                   Don’t be shy about inquiring who is handling your
                   assignment, what are their credentials, are they licensed
                   and if this involves sub-contractors.
