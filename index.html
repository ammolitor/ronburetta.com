                <p align="center">2018 IN REVIEW</p>
                <p>Lawsuits regarding employment screening continue to increase
                    for a number of reasons. Let's start at the beginning.
                    Before conducting a pre-employment background check, you
                    must have a signed release. It must be a standalone document
                    not buried in the application. What is permissible to ask in
                    one state may not be in another. It can even vary city by
                    city within the same state. “Ban the Box” statutes, overly
                    broad questions or terms such as “maiden” name can lead to
                    legal problems.
                <p>A pre-employment background check is considered a consumer
                    report. It falls under the guidelines of the Fair Credit
                    Report Act. If an applicant is denied employment, retention
                    or a promotion based on that report there are specific steps
                    to follow. Acquaint yourselves with the FCRA, follow those
                    guidelines and it will further insulate you from employment
                    litigation. Smaller companies without the advice of counsel
                    or lacking a human resource professional are the most at
                    risk. If in doubt on what is legal, ask. Tragically,
                    workplace violence is making the news more than ever.
                    Screening of applicants will reduce that risk. If the
                    unthinkable still happens, the employer can at least
                    document proper screening procedures were in place.
                <p>Subcontracting of cases, especially on surveillance, is
                    picking up speed nationwide. We are members of multiple
                    professional organizations and online groups. We have been
                    approached numerous times to work as a subcontractor. What
                    is no longer surprising is the fee proposed is less than
                    what we pay our own employees. Someone is handling these
                    cases based primarily on a willingness to work cheap.
                <p>There should not be a filter between the client and the
                    person handling the case. Know who is handling your
                    assignment. Don't be bashful about asking for the
                    investigator's name and cell number so an immediate update
                    can be obtained. After all, you are paying the bill. Make
                    certain the investigation is being worked by an employee of
                    the investigative agency you retained unless otherwise
                    arranged. You would be very surprised at the amount of work
                    which is sub-contracted. If the case is serious enough to
                    warrant surveillance, it deserves an experienced
                    professional not the lowest bidder.
                <p>Privacy concerns continue to eliminate, restrict or delay
                    investigative options. Within the past two decades there
                    have been changes in the law regarding video surveillance in
                    Missouri and Illinois. In January 2010 Missouri changed the
                    videotaping laws. Before, if a person was inside a residence
                    and could be observed from a public area without special
                    optics, videotaping was permissible. That changed when
                    Missouri started licensing private investigators. Those
                    statutes specifically prohibited videotaping under those
                    circumstances and bar any such evidence from being used in
                    the courtroom. Illinois has the same restrictions when went
                    on the book years before Missouri.
                <p>The Missouri driver's license data card was a useful tool as
                    the second page contained health questions. Ever have a
                    plaintiff claim they were in a wheelchair yet their driver's
                    license issued after the claim date showed no physical
                    restrictions? We have. Now a court order is needed to obtain
                    the data card.
                <p>2018 found changes in the availability, expungement or delays
                    in obtaining Missouri records. On January 1 Senate Bill 588
                    went into effect. This substantially broadened the list of
                    crimes now available for expungement. This is a plus for
                    those trying to change for the better but has the potential
                    of a big down side for employers, landlords and other
                    members of society. Prior to this year, statewide marriage
                    record searches were easily available for a nominal fee.
                    Access to that record is now limited and doesn't include
                    investigators without a notarized release. In late 2018 the
                    Driver's License Bureau added restrictions on the release of
                    a driver's license photograph. It is still available but
                    requires more steps. Also late in 2018 the Department of
                    Professional Regulation no longer included license
                    verification for Doctors on their website. There are other
                    changes under consideration which will be covered in updates
                    to our website.
                <p>The trend in closing or restricting records is not limited to
                    governmental bodies. Until recently, on Facebook you could
                    sometimes find a camouflaged account by inputting a
                    telephone number or an email address. Those options are now
                    gone. These closed or narrowed information doors are not
                    fatal just that it now takes more steps in handling a case.
                    Investigators need to keep learning and always have a plan
                    B.
