                <p><strong>January 3:</strong> The New Year found us handling a complex estate case involving a very wealthy decedent. It illustrated knowing where tangible assets such as high end jewelry, art work and personal property were kept and who was to receive what. If it has been years since your will or trust has been updated, the time to do so is now not in a fog of death or impaired mental capacity.</p>
                <p><strong>January 4:</strong> We were approached for the umpteenth time to work for as a surveillance sub-contractor. The agency posted they were hiring for the states of Missouri and Kansas. Just as many times before, we declined their paltry proposal. Please know who is handling your case. Just because a company claims they are “nationwide” doesn’t mean they are. Many of these cases are handed off to the lowest bidder. Insist on having contact information for the people actually doing the field work not someone hundreds of miles away. Make sure the investigator is licensed, carries insurance and determine if he/she is an employee or a sub-contractor.</p>
                <p><strong>February 15:</strong> A new client called regarding a problem tenant. A quick background check found the renter was a convicted felon with a looming court date on a felony charge. The client was advised the deadbeat had a history of violence, criminal convitctions and was judgment proof. It is easier to avoid a problem than solve one. A cheap background check would have saved the client thousands of dollars, time and aggravation.</p>
                <p><strong>February 25:</strong> We were consultants on yet another intrusion of seclusion case. To add more fuel to the legal fire, the investigator and their out of state agency were unlicensed. It is too early to see what direction the case will take. If a lawsuit is filed, you can count on the insurance company being named as a defendant. In each case we’ve worked on, written about or researched, every court has allowed punitive damages. All of these cases, excluding one, settled prior to trial. Once again, know who is working on yours. There should not be a filter between you and the person doing the work.</p>
                <p><strong>March 1:</strong> In our “2021 in review” we posted about a flawed background check. In that instance, an employment screening company, using only “artificial intelligence”, gave the thumbs up on an applicant despite a serious criminal history. History repeated itself when he kidnapped and raped a tenant in the apartment complex where he was the maintenance man. There is no such thing as a “national” criminal history search as advertised by some databank services and investigators. This will be one of the topics covered in our upcoming March 2, 2023 presentation at the law firm of Evans & Dixon.</p>
                <p><strong>March 6:</strong> The Missouri State Highway Department erected a sign on east and westbound Hwy 70 in St. Peters, Missouri. It read “In loving memory of L CPL Joseph Hueckel our beloved son”. Keep our armed forces members and their loved ones in your prayers.</p>
                <p><strong>July 15:</strong> Marked the three year anniversary when Martin Hueckel of CDA and our agency joined forces. This has worked well for clients, employees and both agencies.</p>
                <p><strong>August 5:</strong> Marked our forty one year business anniversary. Some of our clients have been with us since day one. Your business and friendship is heartfelt.</p>
                <p><strong>September 1:</strong> We contacted a Louisiana investigator regarding a criminal case not available online. He proceeded to tell us he could run a “national” criminal history search. We chatted for a few minutes not calling him out his bogus claim. When an investigator tells you they can run a “national” criminal history search, they are either badly mistaken or lying. It is one or the other. If you’ve been on the receiving end on one of our lectures, you know there are multiple sources to check in conducting a proper record search.</p>
                <p><strong>October 4:</strong> A Jefferson County Missouri personal injury lawsuit went to a jury. The demand was for $500,000. The plaintiff was awarded $40,000.  A background check coupled with a successful surveillance amounted to a win for our client.</p>
                <p><strong>October 11:</strong> A man threatened litigation over the severance of a partnership. A background check identified him as the kingpin of an advance payment scheme. An affidavit from an FBI agent detailed the subject having defrauded people of a minimum of 1.7 million dollars. That, a stint in the Federal Bureau of Prisons and other nefarious business activities uncovered, ended the lawsuit sabre rattling.</p>
                <p><strong>October 14:</strong> Buretta gave a one hour speech entitled “Improving on Depositions” for the law firm of Brinker & Doyen. This presentation qualified as continuing education credit by the Missouri Bar Association. If your legal or claims department is in need of a guest speaker, feel free to contact us. There is no charge if the talk is done online or in-person in the St. Louis area. These presentations are not infomercials or war stories. They provide a solid analysis of what works, what doesn’t, upping the odds in favor of the client while staying legally inbounds.</p>
                <p><strong>November 22:</strong> Marked the two year anniversary of the passing of Lance Corporal Joseph Martin Hueckel. He now rests with our heavenly Father.  This was assured as he lived the Word.</p>
                <p><strong>December 31:</strong> We closed the year giving thanks to clients who have entrusted us with their cases for over forty years. Your business and friendship is sincerely appreciated.</p>
                <p>Best wishes.</p>
