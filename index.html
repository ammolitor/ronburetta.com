        <div class="text">
		<p align="center">2015</p>
<p>This marks our 34th year in business. We want to say thanks to our clients some of whom have been with us from day one and most for decades. Your business and friendship is valued.</p>
<p>What's new? Those in the investigative, legal, insurance and business communities need to be mindful of proposed legislation which would hinder fraud fighting efforts and/or have a negative impact on our professions. Once more the idea of taxing professional services is being proposed in Illinois. This is an idea that is resurrected on a regular basis. If this becomes a reality it will have a ripple effect of substantially increasing the cost of conducting business while doing nothing to help the professions.</p>
<p>NCISS on a national level and organizations like ADSAI in Illinois continue to be the watchdogs for our industry. Misguided legislative proposals intended to safeguard the public usually don't take into account that many investigations are conducted by those not carrying a badge. Those in our profession need to join and support the organizations which stand in our place on Capitol Hill.</p>
<p>It has been five years since licensing of investigators was mandated in Missouri. Illinois has required this since the 1930's. Insist on licensing documentation from the very beginning. You don't need that issue raised in front of a judge or jury. We have a few remaining hard copy issues of our 30 year business anniversary newsletter. The focus of that publication was on licensing. The contents have application for those on both sides of the courtroom. If you would wish to receive a copy please contact our office.</p>
<p>We received numerous requests for criminal background searches. There are substantial information gaps if you limit your inquiries to just checking with the Missouri State Highway Patrol or the Illinois State Police.  Would it come as a surprise there are at least eight more sources of legal information to uncover a past or pending criminal history? You will not insulate yourself and your client from liability if a job applicant adds to their criminal activity on the job. You will not convince a jury you did due diligence in conducting a background check when twenty minutes more of research would have uncovered an unsavory history. We've all seen databank ads offering a "nationwide" criminal search history. There is no such thing. When ordering a criminal background check, whoever you use, have a checklist of sources outlined in their report.</p>
<p>For the employer wishing to conduct a pre-employment background search, be sure you have a signed authorization. You should also have a fresh release from current employees when an updated record search is to be conducted. Of all the investigations this ranks at the top as far as the benefits to costs ratio. The expense is nominal while the results can leave one breathing a sigh of relief. There are plenty of headaches in running a business without bringing onboard another in the form of a problem employee. When you are in your fourth decade of screening as well as running your own business, let that experience work for you.</p>
<p>In closing on the subject of pre-employee checks, feel free to email us a blank copy of your application for employment.  We can probably tweak it a bit to add more depth to any background check.</p>
<p>If you are in the insurance, legal or business community, we offer an hour presentation which can be tailored to your specific interests. There is no charge if you are located in the St. Louis area. Due to demands on our time, we offer this service only to professional and business groups. If the subject involves surveillance, fraud, pre-trial preparation or employment screening, it would be one of the most informative hours you'll ever spend. It is not war stories or a one hour infomercial. The talk by our principal is based on his forty one years of experience on what works, what doesn't and on increasing investigative effectiveness.</p>
