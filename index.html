                <hr/>
                <p>We wish to say thanks for allowing us to handle your cases for the past forty years. Multiple clients came on board in 1981 and remain to this day. Your business and friendship is sincerely appreciated.

                <p>2021 marks the second year in which CDA and our agency merged. Year one went very smooth. That was expected as it was a two year search to find someone who was on the same business and life page. The additional manpower and expertise benefited both companies and clients.

                <p>In 2020 a client was forced to pay ransom when hackers took control of their corporate computers. This was a high end business staffed by educated professionals yet their safeguards did not match the skill levels of the criminals. Have and follow a strict set of guidelines for use of corporate software. Make sure your virus protection is updated on a regular basis. It is a lot cheaper in the long term.

                <p>In 2020 a former neighbor had concerns about spyware and a hacking attempt on his home computer. He was relieved when he spoke with a "representative" from Microsoft. On the same call he was patched into a "representative" from US Bank Who, while still on the same connection, put him in touch with the "FBI".

                <p>When your computer freezes up, an alert flashes to call a toll free telephone number and not to turn off your computer, it is a scam. Microsoft doesn’t then engage you in a three way call to your bank then the FBI. There were multiple red flags in which the old neighbor did not pick up on. He and his wife grew up with middle class family values where you went by the rules and did the right things in life. It is sometimes hard to step back from that upbringing and realize there are many people in the world who are the polar opposites. They are experts in the con and make a good living by preying on the unsuspecting.

                <p>If you are computer savvy, help out those who are not. Let those people know about the more commons scams and phishing expeditions. They don’t need to make a $75,000 mistake like the former neighbor.

                <p>On legislative matters in the bi-state area there were no substantial changes having a negative impact on our profession. Over the past decade there were some gradual but negative changes in the availability of Missouri records. Lobbyist for the investigative, insurance and legal communities need to be on the watch for misguided privacy laws which hamper access to the tools needed by these professions. They also need to be on the alert for free spending states eyeing a tax on professional services.

                <p>Speaking of professions, make certain those conducting your investigations are properly licensed. There is no reciprocity between Missouri and Illinois. All states want the licensing revenue. Ask for documentation. If they are performing investigative services they need a license no matter how someone dresses up their job title. Don’t let the lack of a license become a sideshow on credibility in the courtroom.

                <p>In closing, we wish to say thanks to all who offered support and prayers for the Hueckel family. Lance Corporal Joseph Martin Hueckel died in the service of our great country on November 22, 2020. He now is with our Heavenly father. Your kindness will never be forgotten.

                <p>Martin Hueckel<br />
