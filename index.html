                <p align="center">2016 IN REVIEW</p>
                <p>Our 2015 website covered litigation in the bi-state area involving flat rate surveillance that went
                    very wrong. Depositions and courtroom testimony displayed the consequences of working without
                    essential records and using improperly trained personnel in order to accommodate cheap prices. The
                    results were lawsuits against the investigators, their agencies, insurance adjusters, a third party
                    insurance administrator, two insurance companies and a holding company owning one of them. A case
                    where our principal was the expert witness took eighteen months to reach a Jefferson County Missouri
                    jury. The Franklin County Missouri lawsuit took over four a half years before settling just before
                    trial. In both cases, the court was going to allow punitive damages. Litigation arising out of
                    improper investigation continued into 2016.</p>
                <p>An Illinois lawsuit over alleged investigator misconduct is slowly working itsâ€™ way through the
                    courts. We declined to be involved as a consultant or expert witness. If the allegations are true,
                    and they certainly appear to be, here is another case where everyone ranging from the investigators
                    to their client will spend years explaining how this happened.</p>
                <p>In January 2016 our principal accepted the role as an expert witness regarding a terribly flawed
                    in-house investigation. The case had life changing consequences in which no amount of money could
                    ever make a difference. We can't go into detail as the case is now on appeal. When you conduct a
                    pre-employment background check, be sure you know how to do so properly. There is no such thing for
                    non-law enforcement personnel as a "national" criminal background check. A databank provider that
                    advertises it can do so without including substantial disclaimers is hustling a fraud. You've all
                    seen the websites touting comprehensive information on criminal records and unsavory backgrounds for
                    $39. How is that managed? New York has a state mandated search fee of $65, Florida $24,
                    Massachusetts $50 and the list goes on. How about Nevada and other states where a signed release
                    plus a scan of fingerprints is required?</p>
                <p>In conducting a criminal background in Missouri there are nine sources to search. These are all
                    online. If your background report includes only a clear report from the Missouri State Highway
                    Patrol where is data from the eight other sources? Conducting a background search through a single
                    source is not going to relieve you of liability when that bad hire's conduct drags you into
                    court.</p>
                <p>In April we received another assignment also having life-long consequences. Just as in the January
                    case, we can't go into details. The criminal portion of the case was concluded in October 2016. The
                    civil part is now underway. The failure to have proper screening guidelines in place devastated the
                    lives of yet another family. Eventually we will comment in detail on these three cases but only
                    after the last gavel has been pounded.</p>
                <p>Backing up to February, we began an investigation involving probably the largest Ponzi scheme ever in
                    Missouri. The low end estimate of losses was $26,000,000 while the high end was in excess of
                    $100,000,000. This was one of the most demanding white collar investigations we ever conducted due
                    to the sheer number of litigants and the estimate of damages. The lawsuit was concluded on the third
                    day of trial in September 2016. It was an honor to work on a case of such magnitude. We thank our
                    client for the trust they placed in our agency to handle such a high stakes matter.</p>
