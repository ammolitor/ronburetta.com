<p>We are settled into our new office which is an upgrade from the old. We remain centrally located in the St. Louis suburb of Maryland Heights.  </p>
<p>The Missouri Department of Professional Regulation continues to do an admirable job in their fifth year of regulating our industry. The number of complaints handled, lawsuits filed, licenses denied, suspended or revoked showed how badly this profession needed licensing. Their continuing education requirement is also a plus. </p>
<p>Effective January 2010 working as a private investigator in Missouri required a license. The same holds true in Illinois. Working without one is a criminal offense. It can also bring up credibility issues which you don't need in front of a judge or jury.  Our thirty year business anniversary newsletter focused on licensing in the bi-state area. The information has application to any state with such requirements. If you would like to receive a hard copy issue, please contact our office. </p>
<p>NCISS on a broad level and ADSAI in Illinois continue to be the watchdogs for our profession. Without fail, every year there are numerous legislative proposals which would hinder our fraud fighting efforts while adding to the cost of doing business. Misguided legislative proposals intending to safeguard the public usually have the opposite effect.  Those in our industry need to support the organizations which stand in our place at all levels of government.</p>
<p>We receive numerous requests for criminal background searches. There are substantial information gaps if you limit inquiries to simply checking with the Missouri State Highway Patrol or the Illinois State Police.  Would it surprise you to know there are at least eight more sources of legal records that could uncover a past or pending criminal history? You will not insulate yourself from liability if a bad hire adds to their criminal activity on the job due to an improper background check.  You will not convince a jury you did due diligence when fifteen minutes more of checking would have uncovered an unsavory history. When ordering a criminal record search, whoever you use, have a checklist of sources outlined in their report.  </p>
<p>For the employer who wishes to conduct a pre-employment search, be sure you have a signed authorization. This also includes a release from current employees when an updated record search is to be conducted. Of all the investigations, by far, this ranks at the top of the cost to benefits ratio. The time and expenses involved are nominal thanks to availability of online records. Most employers can afford to be choosey in their choice of job applicants. There are enough headaches in running a business without bringing onboard one more in the form of a problem employee. </p>
<p>Most former employers give you only the basic information. Employment references will usually have only good things to say since that is why they were listed in the first place. Be certain the applicant includes both an email address and an applicant's driver's license number. This is even if their job duties will not involve driving. If you want to know why, once more we'll refer you to the publication section of our website. </p>
<p>If you are in the insurance, legal or business community, we offer a one hour presentation which can be tailored to your specific interests. There is no charge if you are located in the St. Louis area. If the subject involves surveillance, fraud, pre-trial preparation or employment screening, it would be one of the most informative hours you've ever spent. It is not war stories or a one hour infomercial.  The talk is based on decades of experience on what works, what doesn't and increasing investigative effectiveness.</p>
