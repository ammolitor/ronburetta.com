                <p align="center">2015 IN REVIEW</p>
                <p> In April, our principal was a co-presenter in a breakout session at the Evans & Dixon Spring 2015
                    Workers Compensation Seminar. In July, he was accepted as an expert witness for the defense
                    involving a Federal Employer's Liability Act lawsuit. In August, he was the sole presenter at a
                    continuing education program for a St. Louis law firm specializing in insurance defense.</p>
                <p> In October 2015, he once more was an expert witness but this time for the plaintiff. In a career
                    dating back to 1974 that was a first. The defendants included two private investigators, a
                    nationwide investigative agency, the insurance adjuster, the third party insurance administrator,
                    the insurance company and the holding company owning the insurance company. Weeks before trial the
                    defendants were trimmed to just the investigative agency and the insurance company. The litigation
                    involved allegations including intrusion of seclusion and trespassing.</p>
                <p> A confidential high low settlement was reached shortly before the court date. The jury found in
                    favor of the insurance company. They further ruled there was no intrusion of seclusion against the
                    investigative agency. Actual damages for trespassing were awarded in the amount of one dollar but
                    then came the punitive damages. That happens when you trespass on rural property owned by three
                    families none of whom were the subject of the investigation. The case received no publicity as it
                    was removed from case.net due to sensitive matters.</p>
                <p> The same month we were approached regarding a similar case from a long time client. According to the
                    attorney, this involved multiple ethical and legal breaches of conduct by an investigative agency.
                    We declined involvement but will monitor the case for eventual comment on our website.</p>
                <p> In November, our agency owner was the guest speaker at the Greater St. Louis Claims Association. The
                    subject was "When the Insurance Company and Adjuster Becomes the Defendants". The talk first traced
                    three successful criminal prosecution cases of private investigators in the bi-state area dating
                    from 1981-2001. Two of these involve insurance investigations and the other pre-employment
                    screening. The talk then moved onto three civil cases and soon to be four involving private
                    investigators including their clients in Missouri and Illinois dating from 2002-2015.</p>
                <p> On December 18, 2015, another Missouri lawsuit against an investigative agency was concluded. The
                    lawsuit was first filed on April 4, 2011. The insurance company, the adjuster, a nationwide
                    investigative agency and the private investigator were the defendants. When you do flat rate
                    surveillance you don't have authority to pull up the essential records. Of course, even with a
                    proper budget, you can't obtain those records if you don't know they exist. The CEO of the
                    investigative agency admitted in his deposition he was unaware of the availability of a common
                    Missouri public record which would avoided five years of litigation.</p>
                <p> In closing we say thanks to our clients. Your business, trust and friendship is appreciated.
