                <p align="center">2017 IN REVIEW</p>
                <p>On January 16, 2018 we moved to 2451 Executive Drive, Suite 107, Saint Charles, MO 63303. The
                    location is nine miles from our previous Dorsett Road address. The office is nicer, larger with easy
                    highway access for clients.</p>
                <p>2017 followed the same litigation pattern as in 2015 and 2016. One of the common denominators
                    involved flat rate surveillance. In October 2015 a Jefferson County, Missouri awarded punitive
                    damages involving investigator misconduct. Fortunately for the defendant, a confidential high low
                    settlement was reached prior to the verdict.</p>
                <p>No motor vehicle records were researched prior to the investigation. The first license plate check
                    determined the investigator was watching the wrong house. The bigger issue involved repeated
                    trespassing over the course of four days spaced out over two weeks. The investigators failed to
                    check public records which would have shown property ownership plus photographs of the subject's
                    residence.</p>
                <p>In November 2015 another settlement was reached regarding investigative malpractice. This Franklin
                    County Missouri case took four and a half years of litigation before the case was resolved. This
                    court was also going to allow punitive damages.</p>
                <p>In Missouri, a driver's license photograph is a public record. That was not obtained prior to this
                    surveillance. The claimant was turned into the Insurance Crime Bureau based on the video. It didn't
                    end well as the person taped was the claimant's next door neighbor. Once again, the investigator,
                    the investigative agency, the insurance adjuster and the insurance company was sued. Litigation
                    could have been easily avoided by having enough of a budget to properly prepare in obtaining a
                    single record.</p>
                <p>A third lawsuit is now pending in plaintiff friendly southern Illinois. This too involved flat rate
                    pricing. Once more an investigative agency and an insurance company are facing punitive damages. You
                    have to use experienced investigators who know what to do while staying legally inbounds during the
                    investigation.</p>
                <p>We are members of various professional organizations and online groups. We have been approached
                    numerous times by both to work as a subcontractor on surveillance. What is no longer surprising is
                    the rate quoted sometimes is even less than what we pay our own employees. Someone is handling these
                    cases based on a willingness to work cheap.</p>
                <p>There should not be a filter between the client and the person handling the surveillance. Know who is
                    handling your assignment. Don't be bashful about asking for the investigator's name and cell number
                    so an immediate update can be obtained. Make certain the investigation is being worked by an
                    employee of the investigative agency you retained unless otherwise arranged. You are paying the
                    bill. If the case is serious enough to warrant surveillance, it deserves an experienced professional
                    not the lowest bidder.</p>
