                <p><strong>Articles 1-10</strong> focus on surveillance on suspect injury claims. These publications
                    dissect fraud investigations and explore what works, what doesn't and how to increase investigative
                    effectiveness. The writings are also relevant on locates, background and other type of
                    investigations. All nine articles have previously been published in our newsletters, <u>PI
                        Magazine</u>, <u>Claims Education</u> or <u>The Investigative News</u>. Some have been modified
                    to reflect changes in technology and the law.</p>
                <p><strong>Surveillance Factors-Educate Claims Personnel</strong> is the best of the above. It provides
                    an objective analysis to determine if surveillance is even feasible. It goes beyond the traditional
                    check list of suspected fraud. A case may have all the classic signs but may also have so many
                    overwhelming negative surveillance factors you might want to switch investigative gears. If that is
                    the case, a proper background check might be the way to go. It is substantially cheaper than
                    surveillance and offers the potential for relevant information on activities, employment,
                    undisclosed health history, criminal convictions and more. If you would like to receive a copy of
                    this publication, contact our office.</p>
                <p><strong>Article 11</strong> is a must read. If you use investigators or your opposition does then you
                    need to know where possible weaknesses on both sides exist. Do you risk having crucial evidence
                    obtained by an unlicensed investigator or agency not admitted under the fruit of the poisonous tree
                    doctrine? How can you use the licensing law to undermine the evidence of the opposition? Licensing
                    of investigators in Missouri and Illinois is covered in this timely article.</p>
                <p><strong>Article 12</strong> first appeared in a 2006 issue of <u>PI Magazine</u>. This work outlined
                    for fellow investigators business practices for making it in a tough industry. The publication also
                    makes an open statement about our business philosophy.</p>
                <p><strong>Article 13</strong> has application for anyone involved in the hiring process. For those not
                    practicing safe hiring, it also provides a primer for plaintiff and defense attorneys on what
                    records should have been checked now that a bad hire has resulted in litigation.</p>
                <p><strong>Article 14</strong> provides an overview on subrogation evaluation and caveats about data
                    bank records.</p>
